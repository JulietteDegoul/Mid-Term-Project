# Mid-Term-Project: Gender Pay Gap Analysis in STEM

by - Juliette Degoul

Gender inequality in the workplace is a persistent issue that affects women across various industries and occupations. In particular, women continue to face significant challenges in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, where they remain significantly underrepresented. According to recent data, women make up only 28% of the workforce in STEM, despite efforts to promote gender diversity and equality in these fields.

One of the most significant manifestations of gender inequality in the workplace is the gender pay gap. In fact, according to [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/ps_2018-01-09_stem_a-09/), men in STEM anual salaries are nearly $15,000 higher per year than women.

This project therefore aims at analyzing the gender pay gap in STEM jobs. We will train a simple linear regression model to assess wether gender is a predictor of salary discrepancies, and to what extent. The model will be trained using a dataset that initially contains 62K salary records from top companies, scrapped from levels.fyi and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries?resource=download&select=Levels_Fyi_Salary_Data.csv). It includes the employee's total yearly compensation, which will be our dependant variable, as well as demographic and employement-related features which will be our independant variables (gender, years of experience, years at the company, education level, location, etc).

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to contribute to the ongoing efforts to promote greater gender equality and diversity in the workplace.
